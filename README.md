## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the Cart System, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- PostgreSQL or a database of your choice

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cart-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cart-system
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your database:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database for the Cart System.
   - Configure the database connection in `config.js` or the appropriate configuration file.

5. Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, the Cart System should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Adding Products

To add products to the cart, make a POST request to the `/add-to-cart` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the product ID and quantity. For example:

```json
POST /add-to-cart
{
  "product_id": 1,
  "quantity": 2
}
```

### Viewing Cart

To view the contents of the cart, make a GET request to the `/cart` endpoint. This will return the list of products in the cart.

### Calculating Total

To calculate the total amount in the cart, make a GET request to the `/cart/total` endpoint. This will return the total amount based on the products in the cart, including any applied promotions.

## Promotions

The Cart System supports various promotions, such as discounts on specific products when purchased in certain quantities. You can customize and configure promotions in the code to suit your business requirements.
